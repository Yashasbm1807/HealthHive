      <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
        Meditation isn’t about becoming someone new; it’s about becoming fully present with who you already are. 
        In stillness, we uncover strength - a quiet clarity that helps us navigate the noise of everyday life. 
        Just a few minutes of mindful breathing can reduce anxiety, improve focus, and create space between 
        stimulus and response. By returning to the rhythm of our breath, we learn to pause, observe without 
        judgment, and move through life with greater calm and intention.
